Chapter 5.6 Available Package Management Systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two very common package management systems:

RPM (Red Hat Package Manager)
This system is used by all Red Hat-derived distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Scientific Linux and CentOS, as well as by SUSE and its related community openSUSE distribution.
dpkg (Debian Package)
This system is used by all Debian-derived distributions ,including Debian, Ubuntu and Linux Mint.
There are other package management systems, such as portage/emerge used by Gentoo, pacman used by Arch, and specialized ones used by Embedded Linux systems and Android.

Another ancient system is just to supply packages as tarballs without any real management or clean removal strategies; this approach still marks Slackware, one of the oldest Linux distributions.
